# ADConvert

Some scripts I'm adapting as I go used to convert AD scripts to many formats, adapted from python scripts given to me by [Brett Coulstock](https://brett.coulstock.id.au/)

# Usage.

First, install the following via PIP.

pip install toml

Use the below command after all the PY scripts are in the same directory as your script. Alternatively, replace the text in the sample script with text from your AD script, then save the file, then run the command below after navigating to the main directory.

`python gen_ad.py script_01.srt -o CompletedSample.csv -f`
