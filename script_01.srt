1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In black and white
a crack of light blooms
into abstract patterns that
ripple overhead in waves.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,100
A large clot of light bleeds away
forming words ...

3
00:00:15,763 --> 00:00:18,470
"DOCTOR WHO".

4
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:22,211
The words recede into the
maelstrom of rippling light.

5
00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:27,889
[FAST] More words appear:
The Powerful Enemy.
Written by David Whittaker.

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:35,665
[FAST-ish] The TARDIS, a London Police Box with a flashing beacon, materialises underground in a gloomy cave.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:53,440
On an alien planet, in a valley between two mountains, rest the remains of long space rocket, hull buckled where it has broken midsection. An external comms dish is still active, scanning the environment as it spins.

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:04,620
The control room of the crashed ship.
The walls are curved, corrugated metal, lined with lockers and equipment.
Above the controls, a light on the scanner flashes.

9
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:11,180
An attractive young woman with shoulder length fair hair and a dark tunic rushes in from the open crew-entry door leading outside.

10
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:15,230
She opens a cabin door into another part of the ship.

11
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:22,164
Vicki looks crestfallen. She nods and walks away.

12
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:51,205
Vicki looks frightened. Bennett, confined to his bunk, turns on his side, his expression troubled.

13
00:02:52,044 --> 00:03:00,890
Vicki returns to the control room. She sits and lifts a hand mic from the console, and operates the controls.

14
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,804
Vicki stares at the flashing indicator.

15
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:07,255
Inside the console room of the TARDIS, the Doctor is sleeping in a chair. Ian and Barbara examine the console.

16
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,919
The Doctor yawns.

17
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,554
He operates the scanner control.

18
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,445
Ian and Barbara look at each other in the awkward silence as the Doctor remembers Susan is gone.

19
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,315
Barbara operates the control and the doors open.

20
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:41,720
Barbara, Ian and the Doctor step out of the Police Box and into a cave, lit intermittently by the TARDIS beacon.

21
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,570
He steps back into the TARDIS.

22
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:11,564
They duck through a passageway in the cave.
A strange creature watches them go.

23
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,274
It is tall and reptilian, wearing a long, black robe.

24
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:31,470
It has a collar of fins like palm-fronds. Its eyes are on stalks, and its face resembles the mouthparts of an insect, each mandible ending in a sharp tusk.
It touches the TARDIS with a scaley claw.

25
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:37,499
Ian and Barbara step out of the cave onto a ledge of roughly textured rock, high on a mountain.

26
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,894
They look out across the landscape.

27
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,429
He grasps her hand.

28
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,010
The spiny reptilian creature from the cave advances on them.

29
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,950
Barbara squeezes his hand in warning.

30
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,280
Ian ducks into the cave.

31
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,150
The creature then blocks the entrance and advances on Barbara.

32
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,540
She tries to move past, but the creature grabs her.

33
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,900
They struggle, and she falls backwards off the ledge.

34
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,750
In the TARDIS the Doctor examines the stone with a magnifying glass.

35
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:09,900
He consults his handwritten notes.

36
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,190
On the ledge, the creature approaches the cave entrance and brandishes a stubby, ornamental sceptre with a clawed head.

37
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,670
It points the sceptre at the cave, holding it upright in outstretched talons.

38
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,600
The powerful energy causes an explosion. Rocks fall from the cave roof and block the entrance.

39
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:05,540
Ian is clipped by a flying rock and collapses near the TARDIS.
Dust fills the air.

40
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,580
The TARDIS doors fling open.

41
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:24,140
At the foot of the mountain, Barbara lies unconscious on the sand, clutching a broken tree branch.
A shadow falls over her.

42
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
The cave.

43
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,210
In the control room of the rocket, Vicki busies herself making up a bunk.

44
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:07,980
She glances out the window and, with guilty haste, snatches a handful of glittering stones from a locker and sits at a table, pretending to scrutinise them.

45
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,730
The entry door slides open and the tall, insect-headed creature in the black robe stalks in.

46
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,930
Vicki looks terrified. She nods mutely.

47
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,610
He brandishes the sceptre menacingly at the trembling Vicki.

48
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,880
He turns and opens the cabin door.

49
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
Vicki presses her ear against the door, listening.

50
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:54,150
The creature navigates the wreckage in the passage and pushes the door to the cabin.

51
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,350
The creature, Koquillion, pushes the door open.

52
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Vicki rushes back to the bunk, and flings back the covers to reveal Barbara!

53
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,810
She turns, sobbing to Barbara, who awkwardly comforts her.

54
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,280
Vicki, distraught, turns away, wiping her eyes.

55
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,270
She rubs her eyes and nose.

56
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,640
Barbara looks grim.

57
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,680
The cave. Ian and the Doctor explore with a large battery-powered torch.

58
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,150
In the rocket ship.

59
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,630
Vicki fetches a gun from a locker.

60
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Frightened, Vicki bundles Barbara back under the covers, and sits at the mess table.

61
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,200
Bennett leans on the door.

62
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,990
Vicki flings back the covers,  and Barbara crawls out from under them.
Bennett looks troubled.

63
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,010
In the cave, Ian and the Doctor, backs against the wall, sidle along a narrow rocky ledge.

64
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,620
The Doctor stumbles, but Ian stops him falling.

65
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,250
Ian aims the torch down into the drop.

66
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,920
On the rocky floor below, a segmented, grub-like creature stirs.

67
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:17,420
It is alligator sized, with rows of sharp teeth and shining eyes on stalks.

68
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,860
There are metal rings set into the rock.

69
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:09,480
The rings are embedded in the mouth of embossed monsters decorating the wall. They swing themselves to safety.

70
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,720
Spikes shoot out of the wall either side of Ian.

71
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,860
The Doctor wrestles with the mechanism.

72
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,540
Below, the grub-creature looks up expectantly.

73
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,031
More spikes emerge.

74
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,170
Words appear: Next Episode - Desperate Measures.

75
00:24:48,171 --> 00:25:14,959
